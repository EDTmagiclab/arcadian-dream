# Arcadian Dream

A modern Touhou mod for Minecraft. Arcadian Dream adds new blocks, items, mobs, and other content based on the [Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki) series.
The mod is still in early development and is not yet feature-complete. The mod is currently available for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and Minecraft version 1.19.

My code is not the best, and I'm still learning. If you see something that could be improved, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
Some features are implemented in a different way than in previous Touhou mods, and I've tried to put my own spin on things.

## Features

Everything in the mod is subject to change. This list is not exhaustive.

### Current features

- A mostly working danmaku system
- Dozens of useful blocks and items
- New enchantments
- Ritual crafting
- Mobs that fire danmaku

- New structures and possibly dimensions
- New biomes
- Lots of advancements
- And more!
